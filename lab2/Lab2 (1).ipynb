    "This dataset is constructed from programs made available by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The data was collected from a total of 43 people and represents each of their handwriting. The dataset consists of 5,620 instances(rows) and 64 features (columns). The purpose of this dataset is to classify peoples handwriting of numerical values by using object recognition. There are many third parties that would benefit from object reconition such as agricuture and security. For exmaple, an agriculture company can use object recognition to detect the difference between a seedling and a dead plant, and in security we can use object recognition to alert staff of a problematic object. Further object reconition can be used for converting text into speech, which helps blind and visually impared individuals. \n",
