What is the prediction task for your dataset and which third parties would be interested in the results? Why is this data important? Once you begin modeling, how well would your prediction algorithm need to perform to be considered useful to the identified third parties? Be specific and use your own words to describe the aspects of the data. "

Another option, build a nearest neighbor classifier to see actual classification performance.  "

    "One idea (required for 7000 level students): Perform feature extraction upon the images using DAISY. Rather than using matching on the images with the total DAISY vector, you will instead use key point matching. You will need to investigate appropriate methods for key point matching using DAISY. NOTE: this often requires some type of brute force matching per pair of images, which can be computationally expensive."
