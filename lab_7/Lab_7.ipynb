Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a description of any newly formed variables you created). Discuss methods of tokenization in your dataset as well as any decisions to force a specific length of sequence.  \n",
        "[1 points] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithmâ€™s performance. You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.\n",

Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. Convince me that your train/test splitting method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice."

Alternatively, you may also choose a recurrent network and Transformer network. Be sure to use an embedding layer (try to use a pre-trained embedding, if possible). Adjust one hyper-parameter of each network to potentially improve generalization performance (train a total of at least four models). Visualize the performance of training and validation sets versus the training iterations, showing that the models converged.\n",
        "[1 points] Using the best parameters and architecture from the Transformer in the previous step, add a second Multi-headed self attention layer to your network. That is, the input to the second attention layer should be the output sequence of the first attention layer.  Visualize the performance of training and validation sets versus the training iterations.\n",
