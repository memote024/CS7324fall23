### Lab Assignment One: Exploring Table Data  


    You are to perform preprocessing and exploratory analysis of a data set: exploring the statistical summaries of the features, visualizing the attributes, and addressing data quality.
    This report is worth 10% of the final grade. Please upload a report (one per team) with all code used, visualizations, and text in a rendered Jupyter notebook. 
    Any visualizations that cannot be embedded in the notebook, please provide screenshots of the output. 



### Dataset requirements: 
Choose a dataset that is mostly ready to be analyzed. That is, it is already in the format of table data. The following requirements should be met: 

- The data includes categorical features (it can also include other forms of data, but must have categorical data) 

- The data must be 1,000 rows or larger 

- The data is not strictly image or text data (but could have these data) 

- The dataset should have some prediction task associated with it (i.e., labels to learn, classification) 

  

# Table Data Grading Rubric 

# Business Understanding (1.5 points total).    

[1.5 points] In your own words, give an overview of the dataset.
- Describe the purpose of the data set you selected (i.e., why and how was this data collected in the first place?).
- What is the prediction task for your data and why are other third parties interested in the result? 
- Once you begin modeling, how well would your prediction algorithm need to perform to be considered useful to these third parties? 
**********Be specific and use your own words to describe the aspects of the data. **************

# Data Understanding (3 points total) 

[1.5 points] Load the dataset and appropriately define data types. 
- What data type should be used to represent each data attribute? 
- Discuss the attributes collected in the dataset. 
- For datasets with a large number of attributes, only discuss a subset of relevant attributes.   

[1.5 points] Verify data quality: 
- Explain any missing values or duplicate data. 
- Visualize entries that are missing/complete for different attributes. 
- Are those mistakes? Why do these quality issues exist in the data? 
- How do you deal with these problems? Give justifications for your methods (elimination or imputation).   

Data Visualization (4.5 points total) 

[2 points] Visualize basic feature distributions. 
- That is, plot the dynamic range and exploratory distribution plots (like boxplots, histograms, kernel density estimation) to better understand the data. 
- Describe anything meaningful or potentially useful you discover from these visualizations. These may also help to understand what data is missing or needs imputation. 
Note: You can also use data from other sources to bolster visualizations. Visualize at least five plots, at least one categorical.  

[2.5 points] Ask three interesting questions that are relevant to your dataset and explore visuals that help answer these questions.
Use whichever visualization method is appropriate for your data.  Important: Interpret the implications for each visualization.  


Exceptional Work (1 points total) 
- You have free reign to provide any additional analyses.  
- One idea (required for 7000 level students): implement dimensionality reduction using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), then visualize and interpret the results. Give an explanation of UMAP dimensionality reduction methods.
